     <h3>Observation</h3>
     <p1> Although at first, our project was going to be domestic, where a person would get to know if a bird was spotted near the sensor, due to the lack of time, a new ideas was formed in which, the project's goal was to help sanctuaries or bird observatories count the number of birds as well as dispense bird seed as per the sensing of the birds.</p1> <br><br>
     <p1> Bird Observatory+ is a fully functional sensor-arduino project that detects when a bird is near, dispenses bird food and sends a signal to the user that a bird/birds is/are spotted with the radius of the circuit. This project was made with the help of parts from a studio nearby. </p1>

      <p class= making_text>Kanishk and Rin first wired up the sensors and when beginning to attatch a camera, they had various mishaps due to the fact they were running short of time, as well as ideas on how to wire it up. However, the changed that to locating a bird as well as the number of birds in an area with sensors. The output was then sent to a seperate location.</p>

      <h7>Website (for promotion)</h7>
      <p class= making_text>Considering that the project was mainly the arduino circuit, Ishita came up with a minimal interface yet design-driven website with HTML and CSS, to explain the project in a documented way. She got the information from Rin and Kanishk and added it into website after first making the mainframe and interface.</p>
